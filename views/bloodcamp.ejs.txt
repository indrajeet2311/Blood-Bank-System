It is a general principle that red cell components of identical <strong>ABO group and RhD type</strong> as the recipient should be used for transfusion.</p>

<p class="one">As shown in the table below, <strong>0 Rh negative</strong> is the universal red cell donor blood that can be given to all patients.</p>

<p class="one">This is common practice when a patient’s blood group is unknown and in emergency situations especially for women of child-bearing age.</p>

<h2>Plasma Compatibility</h2>

</p>

<p class="one">
Plasma contains <strong>anti-A and anti-B antibodies</strong> depending upon the blood group. Our body also has antibodies to A and/or B antigens according to our blood group. Patients should only receive plasma that does not contain an antibody which could attack the antigens present on their own red cells.</p>
<p class="one">
Group A recipients have A antigen on their red cells, so they can’t receive group O or group B plasma as the anti-A will attack their red cells. Group B recipients have B antigen on their red cells, so they can’t receive group O or group A plasma as the anti-B will attack their red cells. 
</p>
<p class="one">
Group AB recipients can only receive group AB plasma. Group O recipients do not have either A or B antigen, so can safely receive plasma of any blood group type.

<p class="one">

<strong>ABO</strong> identical platelets are usually preferred. However, in some circumstances, the need for other special requirements may be more important than providing the same ABO group.</p>

<p class="one">This will be determined by the health care team overseeing your care. For more information please consult with your health care team.</p>
