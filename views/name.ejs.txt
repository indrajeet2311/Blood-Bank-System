   <h1>Body Mass Index</h1>
        <div>
        <p class="one">
            The body mass index (BMI) or Quetelet index is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of an individual. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally expressed in units of kg/(m*m), resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.<br>
            The BMI is an attempt to quantify the amount of tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) in an individual, and then categorize that person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on that value. That categorization is the subject of some debate about where on the BMI scale the dividing lines between categories should be placed.The formula for calculating the BMI is:<br>
            <br>
            <strong>BMI = weight ÷ (height*height)</strong><br>
            (weight = kg, height = metres)
